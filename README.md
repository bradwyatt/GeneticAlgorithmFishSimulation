# Genetic Algorithm Fish Simulation

The goal (dependent variable) is for the population of red fish to evolve by developing traits that will help them survive for a longer period of time before being eaten by sharks.

- The strongest 50% of each fish population mate, while the weakest are eliminated from the gene pool.  The blue fish are the top 2 fish from the previous generation.

- The variables I created includes field of vision (the arc each fish can ‘see’ a shark), size, speed, intelligence (does the fish move away from a shark as it enters the arc), and frequency of turns.

As a result, The fish last longer before being eaten as time goes on.
